[COMMENTS]
STATION,Velocity area station, about 50 m wide, natural control. Station is 5 km d/s of confluence with River Feshie. Well inlet points fractured in early 1980s (giving some data problems), re-laid March 1987. Control started to move some years back, 1990 spate believed to have caused a significant upstream migration close to station itself. RATING COMMENTS:Different high flow rating is used after 1990 spate, believed to have caused the upstream movement of the control. Ratings from current meter gaugings up to 2.1 m (about 1.7QMED) for 1st rating, but only 0.6QMED for 2nd, with simple extrapolation beyond.
CATCHMENT,Geology of Moinian metamorphic and granites. Mountainous headwaters, often snowy in winter. Altitudes: 951mAOD (max), 210mAOD (min). Land use of moorland, tree cover (10%) and valley grazing. Notable floodplains which may be an issue. Hydrometric Register BFI=0.57. ARTIFICIAL INFLUENCES:380 sq km developed for hydro-power with diversions and storage; substantial net export. Reservoirs for hydropower: Spey Dam (1944), Loch an T-Seilich (1941) and Cuaich (1961). CATCHMENT CHANGES:During period of record only Cuaich hydropower reservoir was constructed (1961). Controls < 5% of catchment.
